This was our most successfull branch. We added much more data (10x as much) and spent a lot of time optimizing the model architechture and fine tuning. Given this effort we were able to achieve a testing accuracy of 99%. This is an incredibly high accuracy and thus we were super excited to see such a high accuracy.

The only changes from the main branch is a somewhat different model architechture which we were able to fine-tune and more medical_data. Everything else is exactly the same.

Accuracy: 99%
